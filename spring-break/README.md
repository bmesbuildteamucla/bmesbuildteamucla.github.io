# Spring Break Challenge!

## Submissions

* Each team must submit a video of their Arduino playing the Dino Run game by emailing it to us (bmes.build.team@gmail.com).
* The game must be played by using Arduino hardware, operating independently from any human interaction.
* Your Arduino interacts with the keyboard and computer monitor to play the game.
* You can also add LEDs, motors, LCD displays, etc. from your Arduino kit if you want to make it fancy :O

## In Order to Win ...

* Your team must have the highest score! (All teammates will receive a prize if you win.)
* If at least half of the teams get at least 300 points or add ~fancy~ details to their design, then your PMs will organize a special prize for everyone on the team :)

## Tips and Tricks

* First try playing the game to see what the hardware needs to do. The obstacles change over time :O
* Use the Servo motor to press the spacebar and photoresistors to detect incoming obstacles.
