# Spring Break Challenge!

## Submission Rules

* Submissions are due by Monday of Week 1 (3/29)!
* Each team will submit a video of their Arduino playing the Dino Run game by emailing it to us (bmes.build.team@gmail.com).
  - All teams must submit a video of their design! (One submission per team.)
  - We recommend uploading it to Google Drive and then emailing the share link to us.
  - If you want to prove that you got the highest score, we need video evidence >:)
* The game must be played by using Arduino hardware, operating independently from any human interaction.
* Your Arduino must interact with the keyboard and computer monitor to play the game.
* You can also add LEDs, motors, LCD displays, etc. from your Arduino kit if you want to make it fancy :O

## In Order to Win ...

* Your team must have the highest score! All teammates will receive a prize (gift card) if you win.
* If at least half of the teams get at least 300 points or add fancy details (lights, sounds, displays, etc.) to their design, then your PMs will organize a special prize for everyone on the team (maybe Philip will eat a ghost pepper in front of everyone :O)

## Tips and Tricks

* Access the game on Google Chrome using the following link: chrome://dino/. If you don't have Google Chrome, try using this website: [Google Dino Game](https://trex-runner.com/)
* First try playing the game to see what the hardware needs to do. The obstacles change over time :O
* Use the Servo motor to press the spacebar and photoresistors to detect incoming obstacles.
