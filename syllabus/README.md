# Syllabus

BMES Build Team is a year-long project where underclassmen are tasked with building their own rudimentary biomedical device. We are a student-run program that works to develop basic engineering and design skills of students looking to work in the medical device industry.

In traditional classes, undergraduate students are not taught hands-on skills ideal for research and industry until upper division electives in their 3rd and 4th years.
Through hands-on instruction, students are introduced to fundamental engineering concepts including the design process, circuitry, microcontrollers, codind, soldering, 3D CAD, and PCB Design.

We hope that students coming out of this program are able to apply these skills in future classes, research, and internships.
