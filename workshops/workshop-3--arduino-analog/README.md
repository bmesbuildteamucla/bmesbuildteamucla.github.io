# Workshop 3 - Arduino Analog

## Activities:

#### Activity 1 - Piezo Buzzer
* Arduino functions to use to operate the buzzer
* tone, noTone
* Control pitches using potentiometer/photoresistor
* Play a scale 

#### Activity 2 - Servo motors + Joystick
* Program the Servo to dab back and forth.
* Bonus: Hook up the joystick/potentiometer to it to manually make it dab. 

#### Activity 3 - Light Level Sensor
* Use a photoresistor to graph light levels in the room that youâ€™re sitting in
* Slowly cover the photodiode with your hand to change the graph
* Graph using Serial Plotter

#### Activity 4 - Night Light
* Make a night light using a photoresistor and an LED. (The LED turns on when the room is dark.) 

#### Challenge Activity - Reaction Time Test
* Use an LED and a piezo buzzer to make a fun game! Have the LED or piezo buzzer turn on randomly so that the user has to press the button as fast as possible to turn it off. Have the reaction speed be printed in the serial monitor each time. See who has the fastest reaction times :)

#### Challenge Activity - Dino Run
* Use the servo and photoresistor to play the Google dino game automatically up to 300 points. (Bonus: Try to get the highest score possible.)
