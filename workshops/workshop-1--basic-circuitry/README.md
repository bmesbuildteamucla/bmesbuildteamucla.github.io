# Workshop 1 - Basic Circuitry

## Activities:

#### Activity 1 - Junction Rule
* Make the following circuit and measure the voltage drop at different points to prove the junction rule with Ohm’s law

	- R1, R2, and R3 are 100, 220, and 330 Ohms respectively

	- Relevant Equations:
	
		> Ohm’s Law: V = IR
		>
		> Resistors in Series: Req = R1 + R2 + R3 + . . . + Rn
		>
		> Resistors in Parallel: 1/Req = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) + . . . + (1/Rn)
		>
		> Junction Rule: Iin = Iout


#### Activity 2 - Voltage Divider
* Prove the voltage divider equation using a voltmeter.

	- Voltage Divider Equation:

	    > Vout = Vin (R2/ (R1 + R2))


#### Activity 3 - LEDs and Data Sheets
* Use a data sheet to find the optimal current for your LED and set up an appropriate circuit.
* Determine mathematically how increasing the resistance of the resistor will affect the power dissipated (P=IV) across the LED. Prove your conclusion by increasing the resistance of the resistor and observe the brightness of the LED.
* Set up LEDs in parallel and series with each other. Determine the differences in the brightness and give a reason for your observation with what we learned in the module.

	- Relevant Equations:

	  > V = IR
	  >
	  > P = IV = I^2R = V^2/R


#### Activity 4 - LEDs and Switches
* Build a circuit with a switch and an LED where the LED turns on when the switch is pressed. Then try to make a circuit where the LED turns off when the switch is pressed.

<!-- ## Solutions:
#### Activity 4 - LEDs and Switches

- Green LED circuit is completed when button is pressed, so LED turns on
- Blue LED circuit is shorted when button is pressed (creates path of less resistance), so LED turns off
