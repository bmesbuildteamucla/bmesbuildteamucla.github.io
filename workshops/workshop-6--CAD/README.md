#### Activity 1 - Casing Design
* It's finally time to design (or finalize) your CAD model and get it 3D printed
* Design considerations
  - Finger hole size
    - Big enough for variety of finger sizes BUT
    - The smaller the distance between the red LED and photodiode, the stronger your reading will be
  - LED and photodiode hole size
    - Red LED, photodiode, and IR LED are different sizes!
      - Red LED is ~5.3 mm in diameter
      - Photodiode and IR LED are ~4.0 mm in diameter
      - We recommend adding ~0.2 mm of buffer to the hole size in your casing (e.g. red LED hole should be ~5.5 mm)
    - Spot for IR LED if you're adding that
  - Slot for your PCB to slide into the casing
    - Your PCB will be small enough for this if you followed all directions above (moving parts on top of Arduino Nano)
    - Must be tall enough to accommodate your PCB with the Arduino Nano soldered on
    - You could also just secure the PCB on the bottom of your casing, but this will look much more bulky and unfinished
 * The makerspace is closed during workshop hours, so you'll need to go on your own 
   - Makerspace employees will help you!
