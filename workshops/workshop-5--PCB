# Workshop 5/6 - Pulse Ox

## Activities:

#### Activity 1 - Storing Data in an Array
* Read [Arrays](https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays/) until "Array of Objects"

  <details>
  <summary>(Click me) Why do we need arrays for our pulse ox?</summary>
  <br>
  Each element in an array has an index value and a value corresponding to the index, essentially two variables
  <br>
  <br>
      <details>
      <summary>(Click me) What do two variables let us do? (Think before opening)</summary>
      <br>
      - First, two variables (x & y) allow us to plot a curve on a 2D screen
      <br>
      - Second, our pulse ox needs to track two variables: time(x) and blood oxygenation(y)
