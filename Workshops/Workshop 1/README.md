# Workshop 1

## Problems:

#### Activity 1 -
* Make the following circuit and measure the voltage drop at different points to prove the junction rule with Ohm’s law

  - R1, R2, and R3 are 100, 220, and 330 Ohms respectively

* Relevant Equations:

    > Ohm’s Law: V = IR
    >
    > Resistors in Series: Req = R1 + R2 + R3 + . . . + Rn
    >
    > Resistors in Parallel: 1/Req = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) + . . . + (1/Rn)
    >
    > Junction Rule: Iin = Iout

#### Activity 2 -
* Prove the voltage divider equation using a voltmeter.
