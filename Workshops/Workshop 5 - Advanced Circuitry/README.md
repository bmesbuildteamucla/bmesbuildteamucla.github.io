# Workshop 5 - Advanced Circuitry

## Activities:

#### Activity 1 - Set Up Circuits
* Set up a potentiometer circuit

* Set up separate op amp circuit
  - *Hint: Search up op amp data sheet to determine pin configuration*
  - *VDD is (+), VSS is (-)*

#### Activity 2 - Inverting Amplifier
* Set up an inverting amplifier circuit with the potentiometer output as Vin
* Simultaneously measure the voltage from the potentiometer and the op amp
  <details>
  <summary>What is the op amp's output voltage?</summary>
  <br>
  The op amp's output voltage is 0V

      <summary>Why? (Think before opening)</summary>
      <br>
      An op amp can only produce an output voltage within the range of voltages that it's supplied with (ex: 0V - 5V). By using an inverting amplifier, you are telling the op amp to produce a negative output voltage. However, the lowest voltage it is supplied with is 0V, so the output voltage is 0V.

#### Activity 3 - Non-inverting Amplifier
* Set up an inverting amplifier circuit with the potentiometer output as Vin
* Simultaneously measure the voltage from the potentiometer and the op amp
* Compare the two voltages and see if they match the expected gain


#### Activity 4 - Transimpedance Amplifier
* 

#### Activity 5 - Filters
